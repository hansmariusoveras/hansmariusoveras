I'm Hans-Marius Øverås. I used to study computer science at NTNU, now I work in the marine tech industry in Trondheim.
At Ocean Access, I do backend development with Express.js, frontend development with Svelte, firmware development for STM32 in C, PCB design and electronics/software integration. 

I like computers and so on...
