# Greetings!
I study computer science,
and I especially enjoy low-level programming. My interests include computer architecture, systems programming and graphics, but also web development and very much so game development.

## I have done projects in
* Python
* C
* OpenGL
* Java
* React with Javascript and Typescript
* Dart (Flutter)
* GDScript (Godot game engine)

## I work part time for Orakeltjenesten NTNU
where I help students with things like connecting to the internet and installing obscure software. In the summer of 2021, I created a [PDF  tool](https://pdf.orakel.ntnu.no/) with a colleague.
