I study computer science, and I currently take courses in algorithms, low level programming, 3D graphics and programming languages (paradigms, semantics, 
models...). My interests include systems programming, graphics and computer architecture, as well as web development. I like to take part in hackathons and game jams. My profile for ludum dare shows some of the games I have made for the over-weekend jams: <a href="https://ldjam.com/users/tarfield/games">Ludum Dare / tarfield</a>.
