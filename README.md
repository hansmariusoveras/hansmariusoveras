# Greetings!
I study computer science, and I currently take courses in algorithms, low level programming, 3D graphics and programming languages (paradigms, semantics, models...). My interests include systems programming, graphics and computer architecture, as well as web development. I like to take part in hackathons and game jams. My profile for ludum dare shows some of the games I have made for the over-weekend jams: [Ludum Dare / tarfield](https://ldjam.com/users/tarfield/games).

## I have done projects in
* Python
* C
* OpenGL
* Java
* React with Javascript and Typescript
* Dart (Flutter)
* GDScript (Godot game engine)

## I work part time for Orakeltjenesten NTNU
where I help students with things like connecting to the internet and installing obscure software. In the summer of 2021, I created a [PDF  tool](https://pdf.orakel.ntnu.no/) with a colleague.
